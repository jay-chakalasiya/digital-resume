        details: |
          - Developed an algorithm to detect bone fractures from the acoustic response, using DSP techniques(using Librosa) and ML.
          - Deployed algorithm on the mobile platform by developing a mobile application using Flutter and hosted backend on Azure.
          - Achieved over 95% accuracy except for smaller bones(like fingers bones ~70% accuracy), published the results in IEEE-GHTC-2020.
